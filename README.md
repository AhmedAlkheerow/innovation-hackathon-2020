# How do I submit my project?

Submit your Hackathon project following these steps:
Create a new file in the [hackathon-submissions](https://github.com/impacthubist/innovation-hackathon-2020/tree/master/hackathon-submissions) folder. Please use .md as the extension of the file.
Name the file `{your-github-username}-{your-project-name}.md`: for example, `impacthubist-myproject.md`.

In the file, include a link to a repository containing your project, together with a short paragraph to describe of your work and explain how it would be answering the challenge question. Submit your changes as a pull request. If other members worked with you on the project, please make sure to include their names in your pull request description.

The "README" file in your project repository should include the following: i) The challenge question you have chosen ii) A description of your project/solution (1-2 paragraph description that includes its features, how it can be implemented to the existing business model etc.) iii) How to install/run/setup your project/solution. At the end of the Hackathon, judges will analyze your submissions, check their functioning as well as the impact of the solution for the social enterprise itself.
